# project-intake

Description: Neutral intake that produces research + planning inputs without committing to a stack too early.

## Step 1 — Capture the build instruction
Ask the user for a 1–3 sentence build instruction. Do not propose a stack yet.

## Step 2 — Minimal constraints
Ask:
- Users and roles (who will use it)
- Must-have workflows (3–7 bullets)
- Data source(s) (files/APIs/manual entry)
- Deployment preference (Vercel, other, unknown)
- Security baseline (auth needed? sensitive data?)

## Step 3 — Run research-first
Invoke the `research-first` skill and write `architecture/research.md`.

## Step 4 — Planning handoff
Ask for permission to run planning. Then stop.
